# Container Apps Acmebot

This application automates the issuance and renewal of ACME SSL/TLS certificates. This works with Azure Container Apps and the bot will request and generate a certificate, upload it to the container app environment, validate, and map a custom domain to the container app.

## Motivation

This is an effort to extend the projects from shibayan for compatibility with Container Apps.  This is a community created project with no official support from Microsoft.

## Feature Support

- Issuing certificates for Zone Apex and Wildcard (multiple domains)
- Automated certificate renewal
- ACME v2 compliants Certification Authorities
  - [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
  - [Buypass Go SSL](https://www.buypass.com/ssl/resources/acme-free-ssl)
  - [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com/features/acme/) (Requires EAB Credentials)
- Azure Container Apps
